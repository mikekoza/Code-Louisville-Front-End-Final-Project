# Code-Louisville-Front-End-Final-Project

This is my final project for the Code Louisville Front End Web Development class.  My main goal was to implement jQuery and learn how to utilize it in a way where I can showcase a portfolio of more pictures as I take them and build my catalog.  I wanted to make a solid, basic, and clean portfolio so I can get any work that I create across easily and show how I can be contacted and showcase some information about myself.
